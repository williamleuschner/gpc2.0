## Important Information
Not all of this is mine. The forum (located in `/bbs`) is FluxBB. The styles for the navigation bar are based heavily on the navigation bar for the [HTML5 Website](http://www.w3.org/html/logo). The copyright for all of these borrowed elements is that of their respective owners. If any of said owners read this and object to their content's presence, please feel free to ask for them to be removed; I have no objections.
